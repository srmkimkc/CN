PROCEDURE:
1. Open the editor and type the program for error detection 
2. Get the input in the form of bits. 
3. Append the redundancy bits. 
4. Divide the appended data using a divisor polynomial. 
5. The resulting data should be transmitted to the receiver. 
6. At the receiver the received data is entered. 
7. The same process is repeated at the receiver.
8. If the remainder is zero there is no error otherwise there is some error in the received bits 
9. Run the program.


Inputs:-
enter generatore - 1101
enter data - 100100
received code word - 100100001
