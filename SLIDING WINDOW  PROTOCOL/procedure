AIM:  To Implement Simulation of Sliding Window Protocol
PROCEDURE:  
1. Start the program.
2. Get the frame size from the user
3. To create the frame based on the user request.
4. To send frames to the server from the client-side.
5. If your frames reach the server it will send ACK signal to client otherwise
it will send a NACK signal to the client.
6. Stop the program


Inputs:-
data to be send : Welcome to java sliding window protocol technique
